It was named brownie because it sounds like "brownian" in brownian motion which is an inspiration of the concept of this game
[What is brownian motion?](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-brownian-motion.html). The front end of this game was created on repl https://repl.it/@fishmarket/Brownie-XO. This was a learning project to revisit basic JavaScript/HTML knowledge as part of company training

### The Game
Similar to traditional tic-tac-toe, a player needs to make a row of 3 of his/her symbol to win. The process of placing a mark is different here. Whenever you click 'Drop' button, your marking will be placed at the pointer immediately. The pointer moves at random around the grid. You can drop your mark at where you want if you have good enough reflex but if you're too slow, your mark will be drop somewhere else!

### How to Play together
Each player open a new tab in the link below. Click on a top corner (left or right) to pick which side you play. Whenever it's your turn, the drop color button will be clickable. Enjoy!
